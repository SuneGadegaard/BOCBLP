For each instance a file containing detailed information on the instance is generated. They are named by the instance number and
cost structure (shifted by one compare to the names in the paper. That is C1 ~ 0, C2 ~ 1, and C3 ~ 2). 
It contains the number of non--dominated points, the number of weakly dominated points generated, the total CPU time in seconds, 
a list of the time it took to generate each point on the frontier, and a list of the points on the frontier sorted in increasing 
order of the first coordinate.

In addition, a summary file summarizing the total time, number of non--dominated points, number of weakly dominated points, 
the difference between the first coordinate of the lexicographic minima, and the difference between the second coordinate
of the lexicographic minima.
