We use the following parameter names for the uncapacitated, capacitated,
and single source capacitated facility location facility location problems:

------------------------------------------------------------
n = number of potential facility sites
m = number of customers
s_i = capacity of facility i
f_i = fixed cost of opening facility i
d_j = demand at customer j
c_{i,j} = cost of supplying all customer j's demand from facility i
t{i,j} = travel time between facility i and customer j
------------------------------------------------------------

The instances have the following format:
------------------------------------------------------------
n 
m 
s_1 f_1
s_2 f_2
...
s_n f_n
d_1 d_2 ... d_m

c_{1,1}... c_{1,m}
c_{2,1}... c_{2,m}
...
c_{n,1}... c_{n,m}

t_{1,1}... t_{1,m}
t_{2,1}... t_{2,m}
...
t_{n,1}... t_{n,m}
------------------------------------------------------------
If the instance is a uncapacitated facility location problem (UFLP), then the class rdDat sets each 
demand d_j=1 and each capacity s_i=m. This provides a valid instance of the UFLP
------------------------------------------------------------
For each testbed we have used in the paper "A bi--objective approach to cost--bottleneck location problems" 
three cost structures for the t_{i,j}'s have been generated. These are separated in separete folders named
Cost1, Cost2, and Cost3, respectively.
