# BOCBLP
This repository contains codes, instances and results for the bi-objective cost bottleneck location problem. The code is written in C++.

All instances used in the paper "A bi--objective approach to cost--bottleneck location problems" can be found in the Instances folder in the folder instances and results. Detailed results can be found in the same folder in the sub folder results.

The code can be found in the code-folder. A main file describing how the BOCBLPsolver class can be used to solve a bi-objective cost-bottleneck location problem is given.

The codes were compiled using the GNU gcc 4.8.4 compiler on a linux ubuntu machine. We used the CODE::BLOCKS IDE, and a guide 
to how CODE::BLOCKS is configured with CPLEX is given here: http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21449771
